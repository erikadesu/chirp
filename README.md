*Just trying to learn more about Phoenix LiveView. It's fascinating actually. This is based on a Chris Mccord's tutorial to create a twitter clone app with LiveView and Phoenix 1.5*

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
